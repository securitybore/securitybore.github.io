						<p>
							This seminar is unique in offering real insight and depth of knowledge, without getting bogged down in unnecessary formal mathematical proofs and derivations. We explain DSP including its advantages, applications and limitations. We offer real understanding of the practice and limitations of converting analogue to digital signals; principles and applications of correlation and convolution; frequency spectrum analysis and the Fourier Transform; basics of digital filters and their application; and an initial introduction to digital filters and their design.
						</p>
						<p>We recommend that you attend all three days, but it is also possible to attend individual days</p>
						<p>The insights and understanding you gain from these well respected DSP training classes will help you to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>get started quickly</li>
							<li>make well-informed DSP design choices</li>
							<li>implement DSP programs correctly and efficiently</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Schedule:</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="javascript:newWindow('w_introduction_to_dsp_woking.htm', 'webpage')">Introduction to DSP</a>on 30 May 1-day classes which explains DSP including it advantages, applications and limitations; designing and implementing FIR and IIR filters</li>
							<li><a href="javascript:newWindow('w_fir_filters_woking.htm', 'webpage')">FIR Filter Design</a>on 31 May 1-day class which teaches you to apply DSP to real world design problems; how FIR filters are used and how to implement them efficiently on DSP hardware; and how IIR filters are designed and how to resolve problems when implementing them on real hardware.</li>
							<li><a href="javascript:newWindow('w_iir_filters_woking.htm', 'webpage')">IIR Filter Design class</a>on 1 June a 1-day class which explains how IIR filters are designed and used. You will learn why and how to design, implement and use IIR filters and how to make sure they do work as you expect.</li>
