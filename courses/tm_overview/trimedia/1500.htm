						  <p>The TriMedia pnx1500 and cs1500 System on Chip devices have five independent processors, and five sets of I/O peripherals. One of the processors is the core TriMedia CPU: the other four are a Memory Based Scaler, a 2D Drawing Engine, a DVD-CSS decoder and a Variable Length Decoder. The I/O peripherals support audio, video, Ethernet 10/100 LAN, serial, PCI and I2C communications.</p>

							<p>The Memory Based Scaler implements image scaling and filtering, generation of video overlays with alpha blending and chroma keying, and changing image data formats. The Variable Length Decoder is dedicated to Huffman decoding (important for MPEG). The DVD-CSS decoder is for decoding DVD copy protection schemes.</p>
							<p> The video in and out peripherals handle CCIR 656/601 digital video data. They can also be used at up to 80 Mbyte/s for raw 8 or 10 bit data. The video peripherals also support video image scaling and filtering, and video image overlay with alpha blending. The video output has advanced features for video enhancement including inter-frame filtering, frame rate changing, de-interlacing and picture enhancement.</p>
							<p>Audio input is through a versatile serial interface that allows matching to any serial audio ADC and DAC - the serial format can be programmed with control of the word length and position of data within the word. Audio input and output can also be up to 8 channels through SPDIF interfaces - this is for handling multi channel surround sound, for instance in Dolby Digital AC-3 format which involves six loudspeakers.</p>
							<p>The 10/100 LAN interface supports direct networking and makes the TM-1500 System on Chip devices truly 'connected' media processors - capable not only of the multimedia processing but also integrating high speed networked sharing of data.</p>
							<p>The PCI interface allows passing of video data, for instance direct to graphics display cards. It also supports inclusion of TriMedia into systems (such as set-top boxes) that are based on the PCI bus as a convenient system interconnect.</p>
							<p>The I2C interface is a simple serial bus for control data: for example, this can be used to control video codecs to select PAL or NTSC video formats. I2C is used in many chips for devices such as remote controls.</p>
							<p>BORES Signal Processing offer a one-day <a href="../../Introduction_to_TriMedia.htm">Introduction to TriMedia</a> that serves as an excellent introduction for managers and engineers seeking to evaluate and assess these devices in a well-informed way. </p>
