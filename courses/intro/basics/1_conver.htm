							Most DSP applications deal with analogue signals.
							  <ul>
								  <li>the analogue signal has to be converted to digital form</li>
							  </ul>
								<p>The analogue signal - a continuous variable defined with infinite precision - is converted to a discrete sequence of measured values which are represented digitally.</p>
								<p>Information is lost in converting from analogue to digital, due to:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>inaccuracies in the measurement</li>
									<li>uncertainty in timing</li>
									<li>limits on the duration of the measuremen</li>
								</ul>
								<p>These effects are called <a href="1_quant.htm">quantisation errors</a>.</p>

								<p>The continuous analogue signal has to be held before it can be sampled.</p>
								<p>Otherwise, the signal would be changing during the measurement.</p>
								<img src="gifs/1_hold.gif" width="512" height="241" title="Sampling an Analogue signal" alt="Shows problems of sampling an analogue signal" />
								<p>Only after it has been held can the signal be measured, and the measurement converted to a digital value.</p>
								<img src="gifs/1_hold2.gif" width="256" height="56" title="Digitally sampled signal" alt="shows an digitally sampled analogue signal" />
								<p>The sampling results in a discrete set of digital numbers that represent measurements of the signal - usually taken at equal intervals of time.</p>
								<p>Note that the sampling takes place after the hold. This means that we can sometimes use a slower Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC) than might seem required at first sight. The hold circuit must act fast - fast enough that the signal is not changing during the time the circuit is acquiring the signal value - but the ADC has all the time that the signal is held to make its conversion.</p>
								<p>We don't know what we don't measure.</p>
								<p>In the process of measuring the signal, some information is lost.</p><img src="gifs/1_meas.gif" width="256" height="155" title="Reconstruction of a signal from digital samples" alt="shows the reconstruction of a signal from digital samples" />
								<p>Sometimes we may have some <span class="italic">a priori</span> knowledge of the signal, or be able to make some assumptions that will let us reconstruct the lost information.</p>
