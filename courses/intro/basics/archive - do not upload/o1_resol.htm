		<P>We only sample the signal for a certain time.</P> 
		<P>We cannot see slow changes in the signal if we don't wait long
		  enough.</P> 
		<P>In fact we must sample for long enough to detect not only low
		  frequencies in the signal, but also small differences between frequencies. The
		  length of time for which we are prepared to sample the signal determines our
		  ability to resolve adjacent frequencies - the frequency resolution.</P> 
		<P>We must sample for at least one complete cycle of the lowest frequency
		  we want to resolve.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/1_resol.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="270"> 
		<P>We can see that we face a forced compromise. We must sample fast to
		  avoid and for a long time to achieve a good frequency resolution. But sampling
		  fast for a long time means we will have a lot of samples - and lots of samples
		  means lots of computation, for which we generally don't have time. So we will
		  have to compromise between resolving frequency components of the signal, and
		  being able to see high frequencies.</P>
