	 <DIV ID="absContent1"> We only sample the signal at intervals. 
		<P>We don't know what happened between the samples.</P> 
		<P>A crude example is to consider a 'glitch' that happened to fall
		  between adjacent samples. Since we don't measure it, we have no way of knowing
		  the glitch was there at all.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/1_samp.gif" WIDTH="512"
		HEIGHT="272"> 
		<P>In a less obvious case, we might have signal components that are
		  varying rapidly in between samples. Again, we could not track these rapid
		  inter-sample variations.</P> 
		<P>We must sample fast enough to see the most rapid changes in the
		  signal.</P> 
		<P>Sometimes we may have some <I>a priori</I> knowledge of the signal, or
		  be able to make some assumptions about how the signal behaves in between
		  samples. </P> 
		<P>If we do not sample fast enough, we cannot track completely the most
		  rapid changes in the signal.</P> 
		<P>Some higher frequencies can be incorrectly interpreted as lower
		  ones.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/1_alias.gif" WIDTH="525" HEIGHT="274"> 
		<P>In the diagram, the high frequency signal is sampled just under twice
		  every cycle. The result is, that each sample is taken at a slightly later part
		  of the cycle. If we draw a smooth connecting line between the samples, the
		  resulting curve looks like a lower frequency. This is called 'aliasing' because
		  one frequency looks like another.</P> 
		<P>Note that the problem of aliasing is that we cannot tell which
		  frequency we have - a high frequency looks like a low one so we cannot tell the
		  two apart. But sometimes we may have some <I>a priori</I> knowledge of the
		  signal, or be able to make some assumptions about how the signal behaves in
		  between samples, that will allow us to tell unambiguously what we have.</P> 
		<P>Nyquist showed that to distinguish unambiguously between all signal
		  frequency components we must sample faster than twice the frequency of the
		  highest frequency component.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/1_nyq.gif" WIDTH="512"
		HEIGHT="289"> 
		<P>In the diagram, the high frequency signal is sampled twice every
		  cycle. If we draw a smooth connecting line between the samples, the resulting
		  curve looks like the original signal. But if the samples happened to fall at
		  the zero crossings, we would see no signal at all - this is why the sampling
		  theorem demands we sample faster than twice the highest signal frequency. </P> 
		<P>This avoids aliasing.</P> 
		<P>The highest signal frequency allowed for a given sample rate is called
		  the <B>Nyquist frequency</B>.</P> 
		<P>Actually, Nyquist says that we have to sample faster than the signal
		  <B>bandwidth</B>, not the highest frequency. But this leads us into multirate
		  signal processing which is a more advanced subject.</P>
