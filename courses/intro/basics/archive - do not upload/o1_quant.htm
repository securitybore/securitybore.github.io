		<P><FONT CLASS="grey">This is a common problem in DSP. The errors due to
		  limited precision (ie word length) are non linear (hence incalculable) and
		  signal dependent (hence coherent). Both are bad news, and mean that we cannot
		  really calculate how a DSP algorithm will perform in limited precision - the
		  only reliable way is to implement it, and test it against signals of the type
		  expected. The non linearity can also lead to instability - particularly with
		  <A HREF="../iir/index.htm">IIR</A> filters.</FONT></P><IMG

		<P CLASS="red">Uncertainty in the clock timing leads to errors in the
		  sampled signal.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/1_timing.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="312"> 
		<P>The diagram shows an analogue signal which is held on the rising edge
		  of a clock signal. If the clock edge occurs at a different time than expected,
		  the signal will be held at the wrong value. Sadly, the errors introduced by
		  timing error are both non linear and signal dependent.</P> 
		<P>A real DSP system suffers from three sources of error due to limited
		  word length in the measurement and processing of the signal:</P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>limited precision due to word length when the analogue signal is
			 converted to digital form</LI> 
		  <LI>errors in arithmetic due to limited precision within the processor
			 itself </LI> 
		  <LI>limited precision due to word length when the digital samples are
			 converted back to analogue form</LI> 
		</UL><IMG SRC="gifs/1_quant.gif" WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="106"> 
		<P>These errors are often called 'quantisation error'. The effects of
		  quantisation error are in fact both non linear and signal dependent. Non linear
		  means we cannot calculate their effects using normal maths. Signal dependent
		  means that even if we could calculate their effect, we would have to do so
		  separately for every type of signal we expect. A simple way to get an idea of
		  the effects of limited word length is to model each of the sources of
		  quantisation error as if it were a source of random noise.</P><IMG
		SRC="gifs/1_quant2.gif" WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="73"> 
		<P>The model of quantisation as injections of random noise is helpful in
		  gaining an idea of the effects. But it is not actually accurate, especially for
		  systems with feedback like <A HREF="../iir/index.htm">IIR filters</A>.</P> 
		<P>The effect of <A HREF="1_quant.htm">quantisation error</A> is often
		  similar to an injection of random noise.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/1_noise.gif"

		  <LI>the bottom plot shows the spectrum when the sine wave is quantised
			 to 16 bits</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P>The effect looks very like low level random noise. The signal to noise
		  ratio is affected by the number of bits in the data format, and by whether the
		  data is <A HREF="../chips/6_data.htm">fixed </A>point or
