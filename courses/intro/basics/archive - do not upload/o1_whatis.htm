		<P>Digital Signal Processing (DSP) is used in a wide variety of
		  applications, and it is hard to find a good definition that is general.</P> 
		<P>We can start by dictionary definitions of the words:</P> 
		<DL> 
		  <DT><STRONG><I>Digital</I></STRONG></DT> 
		  <DD><I>operating by the use of discrete signals to represent data in
			 the form of numbers</I></DD> 
		  <DT><STRONG><I>Signal</I></STRONG></DT> 
		  <DD><I>a variable parameter by which information is conveyed through an
			 electronic circuit</I></DD> 
		  <DT><STRONG><I>Processing</I></STRONG></DT> 
		  <DD><I>to perform operations on data according to programmed
			 instructions</I> </DD> 
		</DL> 
		<P>Which leads us to a simple definition of:</P> 
		<DL> 
		  <DT><STRONG>Digital Signal processing</STRONG></DT> 
		  <DD>changing or analysing information which is measured as discrete
			 sequences of numbers</DD> 
		</DL> 
		<P>Note two unique features of Digital Signal processing as opposed to
		  plain old ordinary digital processing:</P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>signals come from the real world - this intimate connection with
			 the real world leads to many unique needs such as the need to react in real
			 time and a need to measure signals and <A HREF="1_conver.htm">convert</A> them
			 to digital numbers</LI> 
		  <LI>signals are discrete - which means the information in between
			 discrete samples is lost</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P>The advantages of DSP are common to many digital systems and
		  include:</P> 
		<P><STRONG>Versatility:</STRONG></P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>digital systems can be reprogrammed for other applications (at
			 least where programmable DSP chips are used)</LI> 
		  <LI>digital systems can be ported to different hardware (for example a
			 different DSP chip or board level product)</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P><STRONG>Repeatability:</STRONG></P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>digital systems can be easily duplicated</LI> 
		  <LI>digital systems do not depend on strict component tolerances</LI> 
		  <LI>digital system responses do not drift with temperature</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P><STRONG>Simplicity:</STRONG></P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>some things can be done more easily digitally than with analogue
			 systems</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P>DSP is used in a very wide variety of applications.</P> 
		<P><IMG SRC="gifs/1_where.gif" WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="115"></P> 
		<P>but most share some common features:</P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>they use a lot of maths (multiplying and adding signals)</LI> 
		  <LI>they deal with signals that come from the real world</LI> 
		  <LI>they require a response in a certain time</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P>Where general purpose <A HREF="../chips/index.htm">DSP processors</A>
		  are concerned, most applications deal with signal frequencies that are in the
		  audio range.</P>
