		<P>Most DSP applications deal with analogue signals.</P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>the analogue signal has to be converted to digital form</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P>The analogue signal - a continuous variable defined with infinite
		  precision - is converted to a discrete sequence of measured values which are
		  represented digitally.</P> 
		<P>Information is lost in converting from analogue to digital, due
		  to:</P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>inaccuracies in the measurement</LI> 
		  <LI>uncertainty in timing</LI> 
		  <LI>limits on the duration of the measuremen</LI>

		<P>The continuous analogue signal has to be held before it can be
		  sampled.</P> 
		<P>Otherwise, the signal would be changing during the
		  measurement.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/1_hold.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="241"> 
		<P>Only after it has been held can the signal be measured, and the
		  measurement converted to a digital value.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/1_hold2.gif"
		WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="56"> 
		<P>The sampling results in a discrete set of digital numbers that
		  represent measurements of the signal - usually taken at equal intervals of
		  time.</P> 
		<P>Note that the sampling takes place after the hold. This means that we
		  can sometimes use a slower Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC) than might seem
		  required at first sight. The hold circuit must act fast - fast enough that the
		  signal is not changing during the time the circuit is acquiring the signal
		  value - but the ADC has all the time that the signal is held to make its
		  conversion.</P> 
		<P>We don't know what we don't measure.</P> 
		<P>In the process of measuring the signal, some information is
		  lost.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/1_meas.gif" WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="155"> 
		<P>Sometimes we may have some <I>a priori</I> knowledge of the signal, or
		  be able to make some assumptions that will let us reconstruct the lost
		  information.</P>
