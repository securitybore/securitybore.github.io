							<p>The Texas TMS320C60 is radically different from other DSP processors, in using a Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) format. It issues a 256 bit instruction, containing up to 8 separate 'mini instructions' to each of 8 functional units.</p> 
							<p>Because of the radically different concept, it an be hard to compare this processor with other, more traditional, DSP processors. But despite this, the 'C60 can still be viewed in a similar way to other DSP processors, which makes apparent the fact that it basically has two data paths each capable of a multiply/accumulate.</p>
							<img src="gifs/6_c60.gif" width="512"	height="383" title="TMS320C60" alt="TMS320C60" /> 
							<p>Note that this diagram is very different from the way Texas Instruments draw it. This is for several reasons:</p> 
							<ul> 
		  					<li>Texas Instruments tend to draw their processors as a set of subsystems, each with a separate block diagram</li> 
		  					<li>my diagram does not show some of the more esoteric features such as	the bus switching arrangement to address the multiple external memory accesses that are required to load the eight 'mini-instructions'</li> 
							</ul> 
							<p>An important point is raised by the placing of the address generation unit on the diagram. Texas Instruments draw the C60 block diagram as having four arithmetic units in each data path - whereas my diagram shows only three. The fourth unit is in fact the address generation calculation. Following my practice for all other DSP processors, I show address generation as separate		  from the arithmetic units - address calculation being assumed by the presence of address registers as is the case in all DSP processors. The C60 can in fact choose to use the address generation unit for general purpose calculations if	  it is not calculating addresses - this is similar, for example, to the Lucent DSP32C: so Texas Instruments' approach is also valid - but for most classic DSP operations address generation would be required and so the unit would not be available for general purpose use.</p> 
							<p>There is an interesting side effect of this. Texas Instruments rate the C60 as a 1600 MIPS device - on the basis that it runs at 200 MHz, and has two data paths each with four execution units: 200 MHz x 2 x 4=1600 MIPS. But from my diagram, treating the address generation separately, we see only three execution units per data path: 200 MHz x 2 x 3=1200 MIPS. The latter figure is that actually achieved in quoted benchmarks for an FIR filter, and reflects the device's ability to perform arithmetic.</p> 
							<p>This illustrates a problem in evaluating DSP processors. It is very hard to compare like with like - not least, because all manufacturers present their designs in such a way that they show their best performance. The lesson to draw is that one cannot rely on MIPS, MOPS or Mflops ratings but must carefully try to understand the features of each candidate processor and how they differ from each other - then make a choice based on the best match to the particular application. It is very important to note that a DSP processor's specialised design means it will achieve any quoted MIPS, MOPS or Mflops rating only if programmed to take advantage of all the parallel features it offers.</p>
