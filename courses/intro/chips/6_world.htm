							<p>In addition to the mathematics, in practice <a href="../basics/1_whatis.htm">DSP</a> is mostly dealing with the real world. Although this aspect is often forgotten, it is of great importance and marks some of the greatest distinctions between DSP processors and general purpose microprocessors:</p>
							<img src="gifs/6_world.gif" width="512"	height="316" title="DSP and the real world" alt="DSP and the real world"> 
							<p>In a typical DSP application, the processor will have to deal with multiple sources of data from the real world. In each case, the processor may have to be able to receive and transmit data in real time, without interrupting its internal mathematical operations. There are three sources of data from the real world:</p> 
							<ul> 
		  					<li>signals coming in and going out</li> 
		  					<li>communication with an overall system controller of a different type</li> 
		  					<li>communication with other DSP processors of the same type</li> 
							</ul> 
							<p>These multiple communications routes mark the most important distinctions between DSP processors and general purpose processors.</p> 
							<p class="note">When DSP processors first came out, they were rather fast processors: for example the first floating point DSP - the AT&amp;T DSP32 - ran at 16 MHz at a time when PC computer clocks were 5 MHz. This meant that we had very fast floating point processors: a fashionable demonstration at the time was to plug a DSP board into a PC and run a fractal (Mandelbrot) calculation on the DSP and on a PC side by side. The DSP fractal was of course faster. Today, however, the fastest DSP processor is the Texas TMS320C6201 which runs at 200 MHz. This is no longer very fast compared with an entry level PC. And the same fractal today will actually run faster on the PC than on the DSP. But DSP processors are still used - why? The answer lies only partly in that the DSP can run several operations in parallel: a far more basic answer is that the DSP can handle signals very much better than a Pentium. Try feeding eight channels of high quality audio data in and out of a Pentium simultaneously in real time, without impacting on the processor performance, if you want to see a real difference.</p> 
							<p>The need to deal with these different sources of data efficiently leads to special communication features on DSP processors:</p>
