							<p>DSP often involves a need to switch rapidly between one task and another: for example, on the occurrence of an interrupt. This would usually require all registers currently in use to be saved, and then restored after servicing the interrupt. The DSP16A and the Analogue Devices ADSP2181 use two sets of <a href="6_maths.htm">address generation registers</a>:</p>
							<img src="gifs/6_2181.gif" width="512" height="394" title="ADSP2181" alt="ADSP2181" /> 
							<p>The two sets of <a href="6_maths.htm">address generation registers</a>can be swapped as a fast alternative to saving and restoring registers when switching between tasks. The ADSP2181 also has a timer: useful for implementing 'time sliced' task switching, such as in a real time operating system - and another indication that this processor was designed with task switching in mind.</p>
							<p>It is interesting to see how far a manufacturer carries the same basic processor model into their different designs. Texas Instruments, Analog Devices and Motorola all started with fixed point devices, and have carried forward those designs into their floating point processors. AT&amp;T (now Lucent) started with floating point, then brought out fixed point devices later. The Analog Devices ADSP21060 looks like a floating point version of the integer ADSP2181:</p>
							<img src="gifs/6_21060.gif" width="512" height="378" title="ADSP21060" alt="ADSP21060" /> 
							<p>The 21060 also has six high speed <a href="6_io.htm">link ports</a> which allow it to connect with up to six other processors of the same type. One way to support multiprocessing is to have many fast inter-processor communications ports: another is to have shared memory. The ADSP21060 supports both methods. Shared memory is supported in a very clever way: each processor can directly access a small area of the internal memory of up to four other processors. As with the ADSP2181, the 21060 has lots of internal memory: the idea being, that most applications can work without added external memory: note, though, that the full <a href="6_mem.htm">Harvard architecture</a> is not brought off chip, which means they really need the on-chip memory to be big enough for most applications.</p>
