		<P>The correlation function shows how similar two signals are, and for
		  how long they remain similar when one is shifted with respect to the other.</P>
		
		<P>Correlating a signal with itself is called <A
		  HREF="2_auto.htm">autocorrelation</A>. Different sorts of signal have
		  distinctly different autocorrelation functions. We can use these differences to
		  tell signals apart.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/2_func.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="290"> 
		<P>The diagram shows three different types of signal:</P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>Random noise is defined to be uncorrelated - this means it is only
			 similar to itself with no shift at all. Even a shift of one sample either way
			 means there is no correlation at all, so the correlation function of random
			 noise with itself is a single sharp spike at shift zero.</LI> 
		  <LI>Periodic signals go in and out of phase as one is shifted with
			 respect to the other. So they will show strong correlation at any shift where
			 the peaks coincide. The autocorrelation function of a periodic signal is itself
			 a periodic signal, with a period the same as that of the original signal.</LI> 
		  <LI>Short signals can only be similar to themselves for small values of
			 shift, so their autocorrelation functions are short.</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P>The three types of signal have easily recognisable autocorrelation
		  functions.</P>
