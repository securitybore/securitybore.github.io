		<P>Correlation is a maximum when two signals are similar in shape, and

		<P>The diagram shows two similar signals.</P> 
		<P>When the two signals are similar in shape and unshifted with respect
		  to each other, their product is all positive. This is like constructive
		  interference, where the peaks add and the troughs subtract to emphasise each
		  other. The area under this curve gives the value of the correlation function at
		  point zero, and this is a large value.</P> 
		<P>As one signal is shifted with respect to the other, the signals go out
		  of phase - the peaks no longer coincide, so the product can have negative going
		  parts. This is a bit like destructive interference, where the troughs cancel
		  the peaks. The area under this curve gives the value of the correlation
		  function at the value of the shift. The negative going parts of the curve now
		  cancel some of the positive going parts, so the correlation function is
		  smaller.</P> 
		<P>The largest value of the correlation function shows when the two
		  signals were similar in shape and unshifted with respect to each other (or 'in
		  phase'). The breadth of the correlation function - where it has significant
		  value - shows for how long the signals remain similar.</P>
