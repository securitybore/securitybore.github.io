		<P>Convolution is a weighted moving average with one signal flipped back
		  to front:</P> 
		<P CLASS="grey">The equation is the same as for <A
		  HREF="2_ave.htm">correlation</A> except that the second signal (y[k - n]) is
		  flipped back to front.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/2_conv.gif" WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="181"> 
		<P>The diagram shows how the unknown signal can be identified.</P> 
		<P>The diagram shows how a single point of the convolution function is
		  calculated:</P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>first, one signal is flipped back to front</LI> 
		  <LI>then, one signal is shifted with respect to the other</LI> 
		  <LI>the amount of the shift is the position of the convolution function
			 point to be calculated</LI> 
		  <LI>each element of one signal is multiplied by the corresponding
			 element of the other</LI> 
		  <LI>the area under the resulting curve is integrated</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P>Convolution requires a lot of calculations. If one signal is of length
		  M and the other is of length N, then we need (N * M) multiplications, to
		  calculate the whole convolution function.</P> 
		<P CLASS="grey">Note that really, we want to multiply and then accumulate
		  the result - this is typical of DSP operations and is called a
		  'multiply/accumulate' operation. It is the reason that
		  <A HREF="../chips/index.htm">DSP processors</A> can do multiplications and
		  additions in parallel.</P> 
		<P>Convolution is used for <A HREF="../filters/index.htm">digital
		  filtering</A>.</P> 
		<P CLASS="grey">The reason convolution is preferred to correlation for
		  filtering has to do with how the <A HREF="../freq/3_spect.htm">frequency
		  spectra</A> of the two signals interact. Convolving two signals is equivalent
		  to multiplying the frequency spectra of the two signals together - which is
		  easily understood, and is what we mean by <A
		  HREF="../filters/index.htm">filtering</A>. Correlation is equivalent to
		  multiplying the <B>complex conjugate</B> of the frequency spectrum of one
		  signal by the frequency spectrum of the other. Complex conjugation is not so
		  easily understood and so convolution is used for digital filtering. Convolving
		  by multiplying frequency spectra is called <A HREF="../freq/3_conv.htm">fast
		  convolution</A>.</P>
