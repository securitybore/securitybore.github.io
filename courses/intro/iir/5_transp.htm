							<p>The transposition theorem says that if we take a <a href="5_eq.htm">filter diagram</a> and reverse all the elements - swapping the order of execution for every element, and reversing the direction of all the flow arrows - then the result is the same:</p> 
							<ul> 
		  					<li>if everything is turned back to front, it all works just the same</li> 
							</ul> 
							<p>This means that the <a href="5_form1.htm">direct form 1</a> diagram can be obtained by transposition of the <a href="5_form2.htm">direct form 2</a> diagram:</p>
							<img src="gifs/5_transp.gif" width="512" height="248" title="Direct Form I block diagram" alt="Direct Form I block diagram" /> 
							<p>For this reason, direct form 1 is often called <span class="red">transposed direct form 2</span>.</p> 
							<p class="note">Don't ask me why these terms seem to be as confusing as they possibly could be - I didn't make them up. I imagine mathematicians sit around at coffee break and come up with new ways to spread despondency amongst us lesser mortals. Here are the two main sources of confusion:</p> 
							<dl> 
		  					<dt class="red">direct form 1</dt> 
		  					<dd>so called because it can be drawn direct from the <a href="5_eq.htm">filter equation</a></dd> 
		  					<dt class="red">direct form 2</dt> 
		  					<dd>so called because it can be derived by changing the diagram of direct form 1</dd> 
		  					<dt class="red">transposed</dt> 
		  					<dd>so called because it is obtained by transposition of direct form 2 - but really, this is just direct form 1</dd> 
		  					<dt class="red">canonic</dt> 
		  					<dd>so called because it has the minimum number of delay elements - but really, it is just direct form 2</dd>
