		<P>If we only <A HREF="../basics/1_conver.htm">measure</A> the signal for
		  a short time, the <A HREF="3_ft.htm">Fourier Transform</A> works as is the data
		  were periodic for all time.</P> 
		<P>If the signal is periodic, two case arise:</P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>If an integral number of cycles fit into the total duration of the
			 measurement, then when the Fourier Transform assumes the signal repeats, the
			 end of one signal segment connects smoothly with the beginning of the next -
			 and the assumed signal happens to be exactly the same as the actual
			 signal.</LI> 
		  <LI>If not quite an integral number of cycles fit into the total
			 duration of the measurement, then when the Fourier Transform assumes the signal
			 repeats, the end of one signal segment does not connect smoothly with the
			 beginning of the next - the assumed signal is similar to the actual signal, but
			 has little 'glitches' at regular intervals.</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P>There is a direct relation between a signal's duration in time and the
		  width of its frequency spectrum:</P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>short signals have broad frequency spectra</LI> 
		  <LI>long signals have narrow <A HREF="3_spect.htm">frequency
			 spectra</A></LI> 
		</UL><IMG SRC="gifs/3_length.gif" WIDTH="256" HEIGHT="146"> 
		<P>The 'glitches' are short signals. So they have a broad frequency
		  spectrum. And this broadening is superimposed on the frequency spectrum of the
		  actual signal:</P><IMG SRC="gifs/3_leak.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="288"> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>if the period exactly fits the measurement time, the frequency
			 spectrum is correct</LI> 
		  <LI>if the period does not match the measurement time, the frequency
			 spectrum is incorrect - it is broadened</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P>This broadening of the frequency spectrum determines the
		  <A HREF="../basics/1_resol.htm">frequency resolution</A> - the ability to
		  resolve (that is, to distinguish between) two adjacent frequency
		  components.</P> 
		<P>Only the one happy circumstance where the signal is such that an
		  integral number of cycles exactly fit into the measurement time gives the
		  expected frequency spectrum. In all other cases the frequency spectrum is
		  broadened by the 'glitches' at the ends. Matters are made worse because the
		  size of the glitch depends on when the first measurement occurred in the cycle
		  - so the broadening will change if the measurement is repeated.</P> 
		<P CLASS="grey">For example a sine wave 'should' have a frequency
		  spectrum which consists of one single line. But in practice, if measured say by
		  a spectrum analyser, the frequency spectrum will be a broad line - with the
		  sides flapping up and down like Batman's cloak. When we see a perfect single
		  line spectrum - for example in the charts sometimes provided with analogue to
		  digital converter chips - this has in fact been obtained by tuning the signal
		  frequency carefully so that the period exactly fits the measurement time and
		  the frequency spectrum is the best obtainable.</P>
