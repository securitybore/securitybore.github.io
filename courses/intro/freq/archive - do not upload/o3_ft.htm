		<P>Jean Baptiste Fourier showed that any signal or waveform could be made
		  up just by adding together a series of pure tones (sine waves) with appropriate
		  amplitude and phase.</P> 
		<P>This is a rather startling theory, if you think about it. It means,
		  for instance, that by simply turning on a number of sine wave generators we
		  could sit back and enjoy a Beethoven symphony.</P> 
		<P>Of course we would have to use a very large number of sine wave
		  generators, and we would have to turn them on at the time of the Big Bang and
		  leave them on until the heat death of the universe.</P> 
		<P>Fourier's theorem assumes we add sine waves of infinite
		  duration.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/3_ft.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="299"> 
		<P>The diagram shows how a square wave can be made up by adding together
		  pure sine waves at the harmonics of the fundamental frequency.</P> 
		<P>Any signal can be made up by adding together the correct sine waves
		  with appropriate amplitude and phase.</P> 
		<P>The Fourier transform is an equation to calculate the frequency,
		  amplitude and phase of each sine wave needed to make up any given
		  signal.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/3_ft2.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="125">

		  <LI>The Fourier Transform (FT) is a mathematical formula using
			 integrals</LI> 
		  <LI>The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a discrete numerical
			 equivalent using sums instead of integrals</LI> 
		  <LI>The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is just a computationally fast way
			 to calculate the DFT</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P>The Discrete Fourier Transform involves a summation:</P><IMG

		<P>Where <I><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">j</FONT></I> is the square root of
		  minus one (defined as a number whose sole property is that its square is minus
		  one).</P> 
		<P><FONT COLOR="#808080">Note that the DFT and the FFT involve a lot of
		  multiplying and then accumulating the result - this is typical of DSP
		  operations and is called a 'multiply/accumulate' operation. It is the reason
		  that <A HREF="../chips/index.htm">DSP processors</A> can do multiplications and
		  additions in parallel.</FONT></P>
