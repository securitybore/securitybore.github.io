		<P>Multiplying by a window function (called '<A
		  HREF="3_window.htm">windowing</A>') suppresses glitches and so avoids the
		  broadening of the <A HREF="3_spect.htm">frequency spectrum</A> caused by the
		  glitches.</P> 
		<P>But it is important to remember that windowing is really a distortion
		  of the original signal: </P><IMG SRC="gifs/3_dist.gif" WIDTH="512"

		<P>The diagram shows the result of applying a <A
		  HREF="3_window.htm">window function</A> without proper thought.</P> 
		<P>The transient response really does have a broad frequency spectrum -
		  but windowing forces it to look more as if it had a narrow frequency spectrum
		  instead.</P> 
		<P>Worse than this, the window function has attenuated the signal at the
		  point where it was largest - so has suppressed a large part of the signal
		  power. This means the overall signal to noise ratio has been reduced.</P> 
		<P>Applying a window function narrows the frequency spectrum at the
		  expense of distortion and signal to noise ratio. Many window function have been
		  designed to trade off frequency resolution against signal to noise and
		  distortion. Choice among them depends on knowledge of the signal and what you
		  want to do with it.</P>
