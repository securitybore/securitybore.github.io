		<P>Fourier's theorem assumes we add sine waves of infinite duration.</P> 
		<P>As a consequence, the <A HREF="3_ft.htm">Fourier Transform</A> is good
		  at representing signals which are long and periodic.</P> 
		<P>But the <A HREF="3_ft.htm">Fourier Transform</A> has problems when
		  used with signals which are short, and not periodic.</P> 
		<P>Other transforms are possible - fitting the data with different sets
		  of functions than sine waves.</P> 
		<P>The trick is, to find a transform whose base set of functions look
		  like the signal with which we are dealing.</P><IMG
		SRC="gifs/3_decay.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="276"> 
		<P>The diagram shows a signal that is not a long, periodic signal but
		  rather a periodic signal with a decay over a short time. This is not very well
		  matched by the <A HREF="3_ft.htm">Fourier Transform</A>'s infinite sine waves.
		  But it might be better matched by a different set of functions - say, decaying
		  sine waves. Such functions are called 'wavelets' and can be used in the
		  'wavelet transform'.</P> 
		<P>Note that the wavelet transform cannot really be used to measure
		  frequency, because frequency only has meaning when applied to infinite sine
		  waves. But, as with the <A HREF="3_stft.htm">Short Time Fourier Transform</A>,
		  we are always willing to stretch a point in order to gain a useful tool.</P> 
		<P CLASS="grey">The <A HREF="3_ft.htm">Fourier Transform</A>'s real
		  popularity derives not from any particular mathematical merit, but from the
		  simple fact that some one (Cooley and Tukey) managed to write an efficient
		  program to implement it - called the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). And now
		  there are lots of FFT programs around for all sorts of processors, so it is
		  likely the FFT will remain the most popular method for many years because of
		  its excellent support.</P>
