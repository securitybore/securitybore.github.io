		<P>If we only <A HREF="../basics/1_conver.htm">measure</A> the signal for
		  a short time, the <A HREF="3_ft.htm">Fourier Transform</A> works as if the data
		  were periodic for all time.</P> 
		<P>If not quite an integral number of cycles fit into the total duration
		  of the <A HREF="../basics/1_conver.htm">measurement</A>, then when the
		  <A HREF="3_ft.htm">Fourier Transform</A> assumes the signal repeats, the end of
		  one signal segment does not connect smoothly with the beginning of the next -
		  the assumed signal is similar to the actual signal, but has little 'glitches'
		  at regular intervals.</P> 
		<P>The glitches can be reduced by shaping the signal so that its ends
		  match more smoothly.</P> 
		<P>Since we can't assume anything about the signal, we need a way to make
		  any signal's ends connect smoothly to each other when repeated.</P> 
		<P>One way to do this is to multiply the signal by a 'window'
		  function:</P><IMG SRC="gifs/3_window.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="173"> 
		<P>The easiest way to make sure the ends of a signal match is to force
		  them to be zero at the ends: that way, their value is necessarily the same.</P>
		
		<P>Actually, we also want to make sure that the signal is going in the
		  right direction at the ends to match up smoothly. The easiest way to do this is
		  to make sure neither end is going anywhere - that is, the slope of the signal
		  at its ends should also be zero.</P> 
		<P>Put mathematically, a window function has the property that its value
		  and all its derivatives are zero at the ends.</P> 
		<P>Multiplying by a window function (called 'windowing') suppresses
		  glitches and so avoids the broadening of the <A HREF="3_spect.htm">frequency
		  spectrum</A> caused by the glitches.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/3_shape.gif" WIDTH="512"
		HEIGHT="285"> 
		<P>Windowing can narrow the spectrum and make it closer to what was
		  expected.</P>
