		<P>Using the <A HREF="3_ft.htm">Fourier transform</A>, any signal can be
		  analysed into its frequency components.</P><IMG SRC="gifs/3_spect.gif"
		WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="268"> 
		<P>The diagram shows a recording of speech, and its analysis into
		  frequency components.</P> 
		<P>With some signals it is easy to see that they are composed of
		  different frequencies: for instance a chord played on the piano is obviously
		  made up of the different pure tones generated by the keys pressed. For other
		  signals the connection to frequency is less obvious: for example a hand clap
		  has a frequency spectrum but it is less easy to see how the individual
		  frequencies are generated.</P> 
		<P>You can use a piano as an acoustic spectrum analyser to show that a
		  hand clap has a frequency spectrum:</P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>open the lid of the piano and hold down the 'loud' pedal</LI> 
		  <LI>clap your hands loudly over the piano</LI> 
		  <LI>you will hear (and see) the strings vibrate to echo the clap
			 sound</LI> 
		  <LI>the strings that vibrate show the frequencies </LI> 
		  <LI>the amount of vibration shows the amplitude </LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P>Each string of the piano acts as a finely tuned resonator.</P>
