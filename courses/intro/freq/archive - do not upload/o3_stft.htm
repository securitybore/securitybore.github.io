		<P>The <A HREF="3_ft.htm">Fourier transform</A> assumes the signal is
		  analysed over all time - an infinite duration.</P> 
		<P>This means that there can be no concept of time in the frequency
		  domain, and so no concept of a frequency changing with time. Mathematically,
		  frequency and time are orthogonal - you cannot mix one with the other. But we
		  can easily understand that some signals do have frequency components that
		  change with time. A piano tune, for example, consists of different notes played
		  at different times: or speech can be heard as having pitch that rises and falls
		  over time.</P> 
		<P>The Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) tries to evaluate the way
		  frequency content changes with time:</P><IMG SRC="gifs/3_stft.gif" WIDTH="256"
		HEIGHT="184"> 
		<P>The diagram shows how the Short Time Fourier Transform works:</P> 
		<UL> 
		  <LI>the signal is chopped up into short pieces</LI> 
		  <LI>and the Fourier transform is taken of each piece</LI> 
		</UL> 
		<P>Each frequency spectrum show the frequency content during a short
		  time, and so the successive spectra show the evolution of frequency content
		  with time. The spectra can be plotted one behind the other in a 'waterfall'
		  diagram as shown.</P> 
		<P CLASS="dkgreen">It is important to realise that the Short Time Fourier
		  Transform involves accepting a contradiction in terms because frequency only
		  has a meaning if we use infinitely long sine waves - and so we cannot apply
		  Fourier Transforms to short pieces of a signal.</P>
