						  <p>Filtering is a process of selecting, or suppressing, certain <a href="../freq/3_ft.htm">frequency components</a> of a signal.</p>
							<p>A coffee filter allows small particles to pass while trapping the larger grains. A digital filter does a similar thing, but with more subtlety. The digital filter allows to pass certain frequency components of the signal: in this it is similar to the coffee filter, with frequency standing in for particle size. But the digital filter can be more subtle than simply trapping or allowing through: it can attenuate, or suppress, each frequency components by a desired amount. This allows a digital filter to shape the <a href="../freq/3_spect.htm">frequency spectrum</a> of the signal.</p>
							<p>Filtering is often, though not always, done to suppress noise. It depends on the signal's frequency spectrum being different from that of the noise:</p>

							<p>The diagram shows how how a noisy sine wave viewed as a time domain signal cannot be clearly distinguished from the noise. But when viewed as a frequency spectrum, the sine wave shows as a single clear peak while the noise power is spread over a broad frequency spectrum.</p>
							<p>By selecting only frequency components that are present in the signal, the noise can be selectively suppressed:</p>
							<img src="gifs/4_select.gif" width="256" height="173" title="Cleaning up a noise sine wave" alt="Cleaning up a noise sine wave" />
							<p>The diagram shows how a noisy sine wave may be 'cleaned up' by selecting only a range of frequencies that include signal frequency components but exclude much of the noise:</p>
							<ul>
							  <li>the noisy sine wave (shown as a time signal) contains narrow band signal plus broad band noise</li>
								<li>the frequency spectrumis modified by suppressing a range outside the signal's frequency components</li>
								<li>the resulting signal (shown in the time domain again) looks much cleaner </li>
							</ul>
