			<h1>Online books</h1>			
			<p>The most familiar element of our on-line training is an on-line book.</p>
			<p>Ours are well illustrated, dealing with each topic in depth but clearly explained and arranged so you can read as much or as little as you need at the time.</p>
			<p>The 'page' format and informative navigation makes it easy to dip in to a topic that is of immediate interest, or to read sequentially to better understand the context.</p>
			<p>Our approach is very much based on diagrams and listings, with explanations that aim to help you gain an intuitive understanding as well as a practical understanding of the issues that typically matter most to practising engineers.</p>
			<p>Our on-line books are (depending on the topic) also supported by glossaries explaining key terms.</p>
