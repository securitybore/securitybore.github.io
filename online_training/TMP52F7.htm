			<h1>Lectures</h1>	
			<p>Our on-line lectures come in two forms: with accompanying audio narration, and with written lecture notes for revision.</p>
			<p>The diagrams for our on-line lectures are not just PowerPoint&reg; slides of bullet points. Our main slides are designed to be explained by the presenter. They are rich diagrams that are fully explained by an expert presenter, both in audio narration and in written lecture notes. Lectures with audio narration do include 'bullet points' but these are in addition to the diagrams. They summarise but are not used as prompts for the presenter to read out. They are helpful to people whose first language is not English, because they give a written summary that can help in understanding the spoken English. Written lecture notes are comprehensive: they supplement audio narration and are valuable for revising or refreshing a topic.
