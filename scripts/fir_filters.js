document.write("<p>This 3-day course introduces digital signal filtering using FIR filters. We show how you can analyze the signal and noise characteristics to guide the choice and design of suitable processing for an application goal, and let you estimate the hardware requirements. We introduce each process in a systematic way along with its effects and computational requirements, including how to specify the design parameters. The end result is that you will not only understand digital signal filtering and how to apply it but will also be able to estimate clear quantitative design specifications and choose design parameters.</p>");
