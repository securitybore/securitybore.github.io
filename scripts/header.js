document.write("<p>This seminar is unique in offering real insight and depth of knowledge, without getting bogged down in unnecessary formal mathematical proofs and derivations. We explain DSP including its advantages, applications and limitations. We offer real understanding of the practice and limitations of converting analogue to digital signals; principles and applications of correlation and convolution; frequency spectrum analysis and the Fourier Transform; basics of digital filters and their application; and an initial introduction to digital filters and their design.</p>");
