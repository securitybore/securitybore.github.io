						<h4>Prices</h4>
						<p>Onsite classes cost £800 (GB pounds sterling) per day, plus £50 per day for each student. You also need to pay travel and hotel costs, but we do our best to keep these to a minimum.</p>
						<p>If you are interested in an onsite class, please contact Chris either by phone on +44 7921 153219, or <a href="mailto:chris@bores.com">email</a> for a quotation.</p>
											<h4>Terms and Conditions</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>A payment or an authorised purchase order is required before a booking can be accepted.</li>
							<li>The course tuition fee for on-site courses is due and payable within 30 days from date of invoice. If your company requires longer credit terms then an additional 0.5% will be added for each additional 30 days credit.</li>
							<li>Once the class date has been confirmed by the customer, if the customer needs to cancel or reschedule an on-site course there will be a charge for any expenses already incurred. If no expenses have been incurred, there will be no rescheduling charge. We will be required to produce evidence of any expenses.</li>
							<li>If we need to postpone or cancel an onsite class due circumstances reasonably outside our control, we will reschedule the class as soon as possible at the customer’s convenience.  However, we will not be liable for any other costs incurred including (for example travel charges) or any consequential damages. We have never had to postpone or cancel a class.</li>
