						<h4>Public classes</h4>
						<p><a href="admin_public.htm">Public classes</a> are held at our office in Woking, Surrey, UK. Woking is 25 minutes from Waterloo Station in London and convenient for Heathrow and Gatwick airports. There is bus from Heathrow to Woking every 30 mins. Our dedicated seminar room is very comfortable and there are facilities for hands-on exercies.</p>
						<p>Classes are open to anyone. We keep classes sizes small (a maximum of 6) as we find this encourages interactions between Chris and the attendees: he likes lots of questions, espcially difficult ones that makes him stop and think! Classes are run even if we only have one attendee, so apart from accident/illness/death you can be sure the class will go ahead.<p>
						<p>The charge is £200 per day. This includes free access to our online training site where there are extensive notes to accompany the training.<p>
						<h4>Terms and Conditions</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>A booking will be accepted once payment has been made, or an authorised purchase order supplied: our payment terms are 30 days and an surcharge of .5% will be added for each additional 30 days of credit requested.</li>
							<li>Cancellation more than 14 days before the class carries no penalty.</li>
							<li>Cancellation less than 14 days before the class will incur a 50% charge, unless we are able to fill your place in which case a 90% refund will be given, or a place on a subsequent class.</li>
							<li>We reserve the right to cancel or change the class dates in extreme circumstances. In this event, a full refund would be given but we are not liable for any expenses incurred by attendees.  <span class="emphasis">  We have never had to postpone or cancel a class.</span>
