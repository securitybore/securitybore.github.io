						<p>
							Our training classes can be given anywhere in the world and if you have 4-5 people to train, it is more economical in money and time to arrange an onsite class rather than attend a public class.	There are many advantages to onsite training:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Saves time and money</li>
								<li>Classes can be customised to your requirements</li>
								<li>Key people do not have to be away from work, or home</li>
								<li>Class can be arranged at a time to suit you</li>
								<li>Class timings can be arranged to suit you</li>
								<li>Delegates can attend only the parts of the class that is useful to them,<br />though we would always recomend attending all sessions</li>
							</ul>
						<p>Prices depend on location, number of delegates and length of the class. Further pricing information can be found on the <a href="admin_charges.htm">Charges</a> page.</p>	
						<h4>Terms and Conditions</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>A payment or an authorised purchase order is required before a booking can be accepted.</li>
							<li>The course tuition fee for on-site courses is due and payable within 30 days from date of invoice. If your company requires longer credit terms then an additional 0.5% will be added for each additional 30 days credit.</li>
							<li>Once the class date has been confirmed by the customer, if the customer needs to cancel or reschedule an on-site course there will be a charge for any expenses already incurred. If no expenses have been incurred, there will be no rescheduling charge. We will be required to produce evidence of any expenses.</li>
							<li>If we need to postpone or cancel an onsite class due circumstances reasonably outside our control, we will reschedule the class as soon as possible at the customer’s convenience.  However, we will not be liable for any other costs incurred including (for example travel charges) or any consequential damages. <span class="emphasis">We have never had to postpone or cancel a class.</span></li>
