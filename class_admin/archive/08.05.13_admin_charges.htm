						<h4>Onsite classes</h4>
						<p>Each onsite class has a <span class="emphasis">standard-charge</span> with a corresponding set number of attendees included in the price. We call this "set number" the <span class="emphasis">included-number-of-attendees</span>. The <span class="emphasis">standard-charge</span> and the corresponding <span class="emphasis">included-number-of-attendees</span> varies depending on the location and the length of the class. Consequently, the <span class="emphasis">per person</span> is the same worldwide. The <span class="emphasis">per person</span> charge ranges from £150 to £450 per day depending on the total number of attendees and the length of the class.</p>
						<p> The table below shows the <span class="emphasis">included-number-of-attendees</span> and approximate <span class="emphasis">standard-charge</span> for each location and class length. These charges are not 'written in stone' but are a guide to our charges.</p>

						<p>For different locations (UK, Europe, Asia, USA, other) we make a <span class="emphasis">standard charge</span> for an onsite class. For locations which involve a lot of time and expense to travel to the standard charge is higher, but more attendees are included, so the per person charge is comparable to a location where a lower standard charge is applicable. 
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If fewer than the <span class="emphasis">included-number-of-attendees</span> attend the <span class="emphasis">standard-charge</span> is not reduced.</li>
							<li>If more than the <span class="emphasis">included-number-of-attendees</span> attend then the additional attendees may recieve a <span class="emphasis">discount</span> on the per-person charge: please contact us for details.</li>
							<li>The <span class="emphasis">standard-charge</span> varies depending on location, but as the <span class="emphasis">standard-charge</span> increases the <span class="emphasis">included-number-of-attendees</span> also increases, so more people can attend.</li>
							<li> The <span class="emphasis">standard-charge</span> includes all costs: no additional charges are made for notes, hotel or travel.</li>
						</ul>
