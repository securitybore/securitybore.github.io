						<p>We calculate our charges on the basis of the cost to us and the value given to the customer.</p>
						<p>There are several aspects to our costs. These are:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="emphasis">Indirect costs of a class</span>
								<ul>
									<li>Learning and understanding new hardware and software products</li>
									<li>Developing new classes and keeping existing classes up-to-date</li>
									<li>Administration</li>
									<li>Development and resentation equipment</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span class="emphasis">Direct costs of a class</span>
								<ul>
									<li>travel - flights/ferries/taxis/car hire etc</li>
									<li>hotels</li>
									<li>class notes</li>
									<li>time spent travelling which limits the number of classes we can run</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><span class="emphasis">Value to the customer</span>
								<ul>
									<li>is the time saved in product development by reducing the early learning curve</li>
									<li>more likely to develop a successful product by avoiding early decisions which have serious consequences later in development</li>
									<li>value increases as more engineers are trained</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>The indirect costs are the same for any class, no matter where the class is presented. The direct costs vary depending on location and the length of the class. Classes that are held in locations that cost more in direct costs incur a higher charge, but this higher charge is offset by covering additional attendees. This is the fairest way we could devise to ensure that our classes are available to anyone anywhere, but also remain economically viable.</p>
