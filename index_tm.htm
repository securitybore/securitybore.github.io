						<p>TriMedi processors are extremely powerful and flexible. This means they are very versatile, but their versatility also makes them complex to use. It is important to understand this complexity in order to get the best performance. It is important not to make poor design decisions at the begining of a project that will cause problems later on.</p>
						<p>Chris has worked with TriMedia for many years now. He has excellent relations with the system and software architects in NXP and is in contact with them regularly as they develop new chips. Learning from them he develops classes to teach about the new chips.</p>
						<p>After many years working in this way, he is in the unique position of having a good understanding of all the processors and software architectures. The understanding and insights that he can give you in a training class could help ensure good design choices resulting in a successful, on-time project.
