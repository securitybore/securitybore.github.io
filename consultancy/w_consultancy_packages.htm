			<h1>Consultancy Packages - working with you...in-depth consultancy, training and ongoing advice</h1>

						<h4>Typical arrangements:</h4>
						<p>A typical consultancy arrangement would involve on-site consultancy to set things on the right track, some off-site consultancy, leading to a long-term relationship through ongoing advice. Through such a relationship we effectively become a vital and valuable part of your team, advising and supporting your in-house people so that they can be maximally productive.</p>
						<h4>On-site consultancy, <strong>£1,200 per day</strong> plus costs of travel, accomodation and living expenses.</h4>
						<p>To get off to a good start, and to make well-informed critical design decisions, you can use our on-site consultancy to get expert specialist advice.</p>
						<p>This will usually involve spending several days at your site, working and discussing with you and your team to understand the project and to advise on important design decisions. This is an intensive process that gives you high value advice and guidance but also establishes a relationship that can be continued efficiently through off-site consultancy and ongoing advice.</p>
						<h4>Off-site consultancy, <strong>£600 per day</strong>.</h4>
						<p>Off-site consultancy is flexible and cost-effective. It is charged in full days, evidenced by time sheets. Regular contact ensures you are aware of, and directing, progress.</p>
						<p>For off-site consultancy we will usually propose a project outline, tasks, deliberables and provisional timetable: progress is usually reported through brief email and telephone conversations, with a concise report summarizing progress and conclusions at intervals. Provisional timetables may need to be recised in the light of progress: that is done by agreement as and when necessary.</p>
						<h4>Ongoing advice: telephone and email, <strong>£300 per month retainer</strong>, then <strong>£150 per hour</strong> ad hoc.</h4> 
						<p>To save time when questions arise and to avoid ill-informed decisions as a project progresses you can use our ongoing advice to answer questions and to guide decision-making. This is charged in half hour units.</p>
