						<p>Based on more than 15 years of delivering well respected industry short courses in highly technical subjects we are making much of what we know available on-line. This is a work in progress. First we are prducing online books. These are aimed at different levels of user and offer a relevant, practical and clear study materials at a really low cost, so you can go ahead right now: learn what you need and then get your job done!</p>
						<p><a href="http://www.boresonline.info/course/view.php?id=35" onclick="newWindow(this.href, 'webpage'); return false;">DSP Basics course</a> is our highly respected and popular online course which is still available <strong>free</strong>. Developed in 1998 it is light-weight but a valuable start for people new to DSP or in need of a refresher. It is referenced by many universities for their under-graduates to use as an excellent first step in studying and understanding DSP.</p>					
					<p><a href="http://www.boresonline.info/course/view.php?id=24" onclick="newWindow(this.href, 'webpage'); return false;">DSP Lite</a> expands and improves the material in DSP Basics. It adds more illustrations which are all in full colour and has more detailed explanations which give you a better understanding of DSP. It is a good next step for people who want to know what DSP is, but do not need to actually use it. After reading this online book people often find that they understand things for the first time that have puzzled them for many years.</p>
					<p><a href="http://www.boresonline.info/course/view.php?id=39" onclick="newWindow(this.href, 'webpage'); return false;">DSP Foundation</a> is for people who need to understand more about DSP; who will be using it and so have to understand the issues that can arise and the compromises that these force you to make. DSP Foundation benefits from many years experience of teaching DSP. We know what people find confusing and have learnt how best to explain so that people really understand.</p>
					<p>We have taken the material in DSP Lite and DSP Basics and have completely re-organised and extended it. We have added many illustrations and explanations to go with them. This new material provides a more intuitive understanding of the aspects of DSP that people find difficult. The illustrations are in full colour and often give insights that are not possible by words alone.</p>
					<p><a href="http://www.boresonline.info/course/view.php?id=34" onclick="newWindow(this.href, 'webpage'); return false;">DirectFB</a> explains DirectFB's features, functions and use in a way that makes things as clear as possible and that explains the background to the application where necessary. It explains the purpose and application of functions, not just the syntax of their usage.
