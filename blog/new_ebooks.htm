					<h1>New eBooks</h1>
  <p>We have added two new eBooks to our collection:</p>
	<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="algebra_of_mixing.htm">The Algebra of Video Mixing</a>  |  The background to video mixing, alpha blending and color keying
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="directfb.htm">DirectFB</a>  |  Guide to the embedded Linux API for video mixing
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These add to the three previous eBooks, on DSP and Image Processing.</p>
				<p>Each eBook is specifically designed for the Amazon Kindle, and the eBooks are available exclusively from <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Chris-Bore/e/B00NT7G7KI" >Amazon.</a></p>
				<p>The books take the material and ways of presenting that I have developed over more than 20 years of presenting industrial short courses courses, and encapsulate these into a format that is simple, that works well on Kindle eReaders, and that is available at a low cost.</p>
				<p>Over time I shall translate more course material into the eBook format, including specialized courses on JPEG and MPEG bitstream processing, and on cache architectures and VLIW as applied in DSP and Image Processing.
				<p>I am also working on some new eBooks specifically on topics that I have found interesting, or found to be poorly presented, over the years. These include a more clear exploration of the derivation and interpretation of Shannon's Sampling Theorem, a new eBook on Geometrical Representation of Signals, and a detailed discussion of the DFT and its many interpretations and implementations.</p>
